## Hello World 👋

🙋‍♀️ *Did you know*  
Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter is estimated to cause ∼8 million excess deaths annually. The effect is felt by the poorest and the youngest, with 1 in every 4 deaths under 5 years related to environmental risks. Furthermore, when particulate matter settles on surfaces like snow and ice, it reduces the sunlight being reflected back into space, contributing to global warming. To address these health, climatic and evonomic challenges, AQAI are  driven by: 
1) a sense of urgency that threats to environment and respiratory health in require solutions that can scale quickly, 
2) the availability of open geospatial & air quality data to measure pollutants causing these problems 
3) a belief in the power of data science to transform data-driven environmental health policies. 


🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved? 

## Commit messages

Commit messages must follow the [Angular-style](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format) commit format (but excluding the scope).

i.e:

```

This will allow for the automatic changelog to generate correctly.

### Commit types

Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance

To release a major you need to add `BREAKING CHANGE: ` to the start of the body and the detail of the breaking change.

## Code standards

Ensure to use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).
