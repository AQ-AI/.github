## Hello World 👋

🙋‍♀️ *Did you know*  
Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter is estimated to cause ∼8 million excess deaths annually. The effect is felt by the poorest and the youngest, with 1 in every 4 deaths under 5 years related to environmental risks. Furthermore, when particulate matter settles on surfaces like snow and ice, it reduces the sunlight being reflected back into space, contributing to global warming. To address these health, climatic and evonomic challenges, AQAI are  driven by: 
1) a sense of urgency that threats to environment and respiratory health in require solutions that can scale quickly, 
2) the availability of open geospatial & air quality data to measure pollutants causing these problems 
3) a belief in the power of data science to transform data-driven environmental health policies.
